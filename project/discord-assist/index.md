### Personal Assistant Discord Bot

This discord bot is a fun experiment by me to learn new technologies while having a nice bot that can take my daily tasks and eventually do anything else I feel is necessary.

Created Using
* Typescript
* Graphql
* Mongodb

#### Requirements

Set up the `.env` file with discord token and get a MongoDB URI, I recommend mlab.
