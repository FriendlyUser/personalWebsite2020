## Personal Portoflio

Created in gridsome used to showcase my projects and to stop having issues updating hugo academic.


I have added extra folders called `project` and `util` to store local markdown files and for data processing.

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to install default starter
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
